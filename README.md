# Black_Widow
A Multi-purpose tool desgined for web scraping, web crawling and guessing logins on websites.

How to use on Linux or MACintoshOS:
1. Download Black_Widow.py, spider.txt, files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt, subdomains-wordlist.txt and passwords.txt and put them all in the same directory.
Note: You do not need to download files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt, subdomains-wordlist.txt and passwords.txt. You can download your own wordlists. Just make sure to change the names to the ones I made. For example if you want your own password wordlist text file then download or create it and name it passwords.txt so you can use it with option c2 in the program.

2. Open a terminal and type:
pip install pyfiglet
pip install termcolor

3. Next launch the program by typing python Black_Widow.py

4. Select one option from the following:
a1    a2
b1    b2
c1    c2

5. Type the domain name.
Note: For options a1, a2, b1 and b2 you only have to type the domain eg. example.com. For c1 and c2 you need to include http:// or https://. You may also include http://www. or https://www. before the domain name which can give different results.

6. Wait for program to finish and read the output.

How to use on Windows:
1. Download Black_Windows.exe, spider.txt, black_widow.txt, files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt, subdomains-wordlist.txt and passwords.txt and put them all in the same directory.
Note: You do not need to download files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt, subdomains-wordlist.txt and passwords.txt. You can download your own wordlists. Just make sure to change the names to the ones I made. For example if you want your own password wordlist text file then download or create it and name it passwords.txt so you can use it with option c2 in the program.

2. Double click Black_Windows.exe file and it will open the program in a command prompt window.

3. Select one option from the following:
a1    a2
b1    b2
c1    c2

4. Type the domain name.
Note: For options a1, a2, b1 and b2 you only have to type the domain eg. example.com. For c1 and c2 you need to include http:// or https://. You may also include http://www. or https://www. before the domain name which can give different results.

5. Wait for program to finish and read the output.

The program is a little different on Windows. You won't get the full experience like the colours you would see in Linux. I recommend using this program in Linux to get the full experience. 

Note: In Windows the program may immediately close when using options c2. This happens because there is an exit() line at the end. This will be fixed later on so option c2 might be unusableright now. Don't worry though, this option will fail on most websites because each logion page has a different configuration which need to be changed in the program to match the values. However option c2 definetely works on the dmva web application in the metasploitable machine.
